## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I knew exactly how I wanted users to interact with this app and designed an old gameboy color using html and css. I used fetch JavaScript in order to request and received data from the Pekemon API.

## Lessons Learned:

Working with this specifict API I learned how to get the requested data and show it on the DOM. I got to use more structural JavaScript syntax and learn more about classes and constructors. I achieved to include a dark and light theme.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
